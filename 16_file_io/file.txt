# 16 File I/O

- A filehandle is a named internal Perl structure that associates a physical file with a name.
- All filehandles are capable of read/write access.
- Three basic file handles are `STDIN`, `STDOUT`, and `STDERR`

Opening and Closing Files

```pl
open FILEHANDLE, EXPR
open FILEHANDLE
sysopen FILEHANDLE, FILENAME, MODE, PERMS
sysopen FILEHANDLE, FILENAME, MODE
```

Open Function ([open.pl](open.pl))

```pl
open(DATA, "<file.txt");
```
Entities | Definition
---------|-----------
`<` or `r` | Read Only Access
`>` or `w` | Creates, Writes, and Truncates
`>>` or `a` | Writes, Appends, and Creates
`+<` or `r+` | Reads and Writes
`+>` or `w+` | Reads, Writes, Creates, and Truncates
`+>>` or `a+` | Reads, Writes, Appends, and Creates

Sysopen Function ([sysopen.pl](sysopen.pl))

The `PERMS` takes by default `0x666`.

```pl
sysopen(DATA, "file.txt", O_RDWR); # update a file
sysopen(DATA, "file.txt", O_RDWR|O_TRUNC ); # truncate the file before updating
```

Entities | Definition
---------|-----------
O_RDWR | Read and Write
O_RDONLY | Read Only
O_WRONLY | Write Only
O_CREAT | Create the file
O_APPEND | Append the file
O_TRUNC | Truncate the file
O_EXCL | Stops if file already exists
O_NONBLOCK | Non-Blocking usability

Close Function

```
close FILEHANDLE
close
close(DATA) || die "Couldn't close file properly";
```

The <FILEHANDLE> Operator ([filehandle.pl](filehandle.pl))
